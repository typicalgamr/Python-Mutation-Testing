# 游빏 Comparative Study of Mutation Testing Tools for Python

This repository presents an in-depth **comparative analysis of three prominent Python mutation testing tools**: **Mutatest**, **Cosmic-Ray**, and **MutPy**. The study assesses each tool based on **fault model coverage**, **equivalent mutant detection**, **execution efficiency**, and **mutant diversity**, using a set of benchmark Python programs and detailed metrics for evaluation.

## 游댧 Tools Compared

| Tool         | Fault Model Coverage | Equivalent Mutant Detection | Execution Efficiency | Mutant Diversity |
|--------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Mutatest** | 游릭 High (62.26%)     | 游릭 Above 73%                | 游릭 Optimized         | 游릭 Highest (1.58) |
| **Cosmic-Ray** | 游리 Moderate (54.72%) | 游리 ~47%                     | 游리 Balanced          | 游리 Moderate       |
| **MutPy**     | 游댮 Low (49.06%)      | 游댮 Minimal                  | 游댮 Slow              | 游댮 Low            |
