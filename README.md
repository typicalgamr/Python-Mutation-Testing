# ðŸ§¬ Comparative Study of Mutation Testing Tools for Python

This repository presents an in-depth **comparative analysis of three prominent Python mutation testing tools**: **Mutatest**, **Cosmic-Ray**, and **MutPy**. The study assesses each tool based on **fault model coverage**, **equivalent mutant detection**, **execution efficiency**, and **mutant diversity**, using a set of benchmark Python programs and detailed metrics for evaluation.
